# NotesReview

NotesReview is a tool for reviewing OpenStreetMap Notes by searching for a specific keyword

### Getting started

Head over to [NotesReview](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/) and type in a keyword that you want to search. Optionally you can also specify the limit of notes which should be returned and displayed on the map. Then click on the search button and all results will be displayed on the map.

If you feel like an expert you can also try the [expert mode](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/expert/) which allows you to see all notes in a list instead of a map.

### Found an issue?
- Just report it in the [issue section](https://github.com/ENT8R/NotesReview/issues/) of this repository
